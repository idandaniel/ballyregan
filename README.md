Ballyregan is a super fast proxy fetcher.
<br>
It provides a python package and an easy-to-use CLI to help you fetch <b>Free Tested Proxies</b> fast, and keep your privacy.
<br>

---

Key features:
  * **Fetch** free tested proxies super fast using the [ProxyFetcher](https://github.com/idandaniel/ballyregan/blob/main/src/ballyregan/fetcher.py)
  * **Validate** your own proxies using the [ProxyValidator](https://github.com/idandaniel/ballyregan/blob/main/src/ballyregan/validator.py)
  * **Filter** custom proxy list by protocol & anonymity using the [ProxyFilterer](https://github.com/idandaniel/ballyregan/blob/main/src/ballyregan/filterer.py)

---

## Install
All you need to do is install the package from pypi, and it will automatically install the CLI for you.

```sh
pip install ballyregan
```

## Usage

### üì¶ Package

#### Create a fetcher instance
```python
from ballyregan import ProxyFetcher

# Setting the debug mode to True, defaults to False
fetcher = ProxyFetcher(debug=True)
```

#### Get one proxy
```python
proxy = fetcher.get_one()
print(proxy)
```

#### Get multiple proxies
```python
proxies = fetcher.get(limit=4)
print(proxies)
```

#### Get proxies by filters
```python
from ballyregan.models import Protocols, Anonymities

proxies = fetcher.get(
  limit=4,
  protocols=[Protocols.HTTPS, Protocols.SOCKS5],
  anonymities=[Anonymities.ELITE]
)
print(proxies)
```

### üíª CLI

#### Need some help?
```sh
ballyregan get --help
```

#### Get one proxy
```sh
ballyregan get
```

#### Get all proxies
```sh
ballyregan get --all
```

#### Use debug mode
```sh
ballyregan --debug get [OPTIONS]
```

#### Format output to json
```sh
ballyregan get -o json
```

#### Get proxies by limit
```sh
ballyregan get -l 4
```

#### Get proxies by filters
```sh
ballyregan get -l 4 -p https -p socks5 -a elite
```

## How does it work?
When you use the ProxyFetcher to fetch a proxy, it performs several steps:
1. Gather all the available proxies from a list of built-in providers (each provider gathers its own and returns it to the fetcher).

  - > Provider - any website that serves free proxy lists (e.g https://free-proxy-list.net).

2. Filter all the gathered proxies by the given protocols and anonymities (if exist).
3. Validate the filtered proxies and return them.

<br>

> **Note** <br>
> You can write and append your own custom providers and pass them to the ProxyFetcher class as an attribute. <br>
> Every custom proxy provider must implement the [IProxyProvider](https://github.com/idandaniel/ballyregan/blob/main/src/ballyregan/providers/interface.py) base interface.

## Behind the scenes
Fetching a proxy is an [IO bound operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_bound) that depends on the network. A common approach for this problem is performing your network requests async. <br>
After digging a bit, and testing Threads, Greenlets, and async operations, we decided to go the async way. <br>
To perform async HTTP requests, ballyregan uses [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) and [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html),
as <em>"asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network code."</em> (from asyncio docs). <br>
By using the power of async HTTP requests, ballyregan can validate thousands of proxies really fast. <br>it to the ProxyFetcher class as an attribute. <br>
