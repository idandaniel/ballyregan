> Tool for fetching online proxies easily and efficiently.

<br>

## How does it work?
Ballyregan uses [greenlets](https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest). <br>
Fetching a proxy is an [IO bound operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_bound) which depends on network, <br>
and greenlets provide concurrency, so by using them we are able validate thousands of proxies efficiently. <br>

<br>

## Install

```sh
pip install ballyregan
```

## Usage

### Package :package:

#### Create a fetcher instance
```python
from ballyregan import ProxyFetcher

# Setting the debug mode to True, defaults to False
fetcher = ProxyFetcher(debug=True)
```

#### Get one proxy
```python
proxy = fetcher.get_one()
print(proxy)
```

#### Get multiple proxies
```python
proxies = fetcher.get(limit=4)
print(proxies)
```

#### Get proxies by filters
```python
from ballyregan.models import Protocols, Anonymities

proxies = fetcher.get(
  limit=4,
  protocols=[Protocols.HTTPS, Protocols.SOCKS5],
  anonymities=[Anonymities.ELITE]
)
print(proxies)
```

### CLI :computer:

#### Get all proxies
```sh
ballyregan get --all
```

#### Get one proxy
```sh
ballyregan get --all
```

#### Use debug mode
```sh
ballyregan --debug get [OPTIONS]
```

#### Format output to json
```sh
ballyregan get -o json
```

#### Get proxies by limit
```sh

```

#### Get proxies by filters
```sh
bellyregan get -l 4 -p https -p socks5 -a elite
```
